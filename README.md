BallisticCalculator
LGPL library for small arms ballistic calculations

The library provides trajectory calculation for projectiles including for various applications, including air rifles, bows, firearms, artillery and so on.

3DF model that is used in this calculator is rooted in old C sources of version 2 of the public version of JBM calculator, ported to C#, optimized, fixed and extended with elements described in Litz's "Applied Ballistics" book and from the friendly project of Alexandre Trofimov and then ported to Go. 

The go version at https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/go_ballisticcalc was used to port the code over to dart.

The current status of the project is ALPHA version.

RISK NOTICE

The library performs very limited simulation of a complex physical process and so it performs a lot of approximations. Therefore the calculation results MUST NOT be considered as completely and reliably reflecting actual behavior or characteristics of projectiles. While these results may be used for educational purpose, they must NOT be considered as reliable for the areas where incorrect calculation may cause making a wrong decision, financial harm, or can put a human life at risk.
